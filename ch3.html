<h2>Chapter 3 - Storage Devices & Media</h2>
<h3>3.1 Backing up of data</h3>
<p>This chapter covers many forms of secondary storage and compares the advantages and disadvantages</p>
<p> of each type. In Chapter 1 you learnt about the primary memory, known as RAM and ROM.</p>
<p>We will consider a number of storage devices later but first it is important</p>
<p> to consider why we need to back up data using these devices and also how data is accessed. </p>
<br> 
<h3>3.1.1 What is backing up of data? </h3>
<p>Backing up refers to the copying of files/data to a different medium</p>
<p>(disk, tape, flash drive, etc.) in case ofa problem with the main secondary storage device.</p>
<p>Backing up files and data on a regular basis is seen as good computing practice</p>
<p>and many computer systems can be set to back up files automatically on a regular basis.</p>
<p>An example would be the use of magnetic tapes to back up internet servers on a regular basis,</p>
<p>or cloud storage companies using magnetic tape or hard disk drives to back up clients' data on a regular basis. </p>
<p>    The backups are often stored in a different place to the main storage.</p>
<p>This is in case offire or some other situation that could lead to irretrievable loss of key data/files. </p>
<br> 
<h3>3.1.2 Why back up data? </h3>
<p>There are various reasons why backups are made. Some of the more common reasons are considered below. </p>
<li>To safegauard against loss of data due to the failure of the original secondary storage device; this could be due to hardware failure (e.g. head crash on a hard drive unit), problems caused by files being overwritten accidentally (or otherwise) or possible corruption offiles (for example, caused by power surges). </li>
<li>To safeguard against damage caused by hackers. This may not be their intention (they may only want to gain access to the information for other purposes, for example to find personal information such as bank account details). However, the very act of hacking in to files could cause problems such as corruption or data loss. </li>
<li>Backups are also made in case the files need to be used elsewhere; this protects the originals against possible corruption or loss. </li>
<li>Backups don't necessarily guard against the effect ofa virus. The virus could attach itself to the files, which could mean that the backups are also affected. Ifthe computer was 'cleaned' ofthe virus and then the backup files reloaded, there is a real risk that the virus could infect the computer system again. The best protection is not to get a virus in the first place.</li>
